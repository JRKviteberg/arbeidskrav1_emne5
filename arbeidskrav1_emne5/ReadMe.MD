# Phonebook Console Application

## Developer
Name: Jan-Roger Kviteberg


## Project Description
- This is a simple console application that stores and manages up to 100 contacts in an array.
- you can search for contacts, sort and display them.
- It can be run on Windows, Linux, or macOS.
- I have used Rider to test the project but it can be opened with other programs. Should be eligible even for mac users <3UwU<3

## Features
- Store Contacts: Keep up to 100 friends (or frenemies) safely stored with all the essentials—first name, last name, mobile number, birthday, and address. No more "Who's this?" moments!
- Display Contact Information: Need details? Get them served on a silver platter, with all contact info neatly formatted for your viewing pleasure.
- Search Contacts: Can’t find that one person? No worries! Search by name, phone number, city, or whatever you can remember—our search bar isn’t picky.
- Sort Contacts: Feeling organized? Sort your contacts by name or birthday, and in the order that suits your mood—ascending or descending!

## Search and Sort Implementation
- **Search:** 
 The search function scans through all contact properties (such as first name, last name, and mobile number)
 to find matches with the user-provided search string. It returns a list of contacts that match the search criteria.

- **Sort:**
The sorting function allows users to sort the contact list based on either the contact's name (last name followed by first name)
or their birthday. Sorting can be done in ascending or descending order, depending on user input.
